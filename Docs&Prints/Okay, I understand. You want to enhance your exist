Okay, I understand. You want to enhance your existing Pflegegradrechner application based on the more detailed specifications and features outlined in the "NBA-tooldoc.docx" document you provided, using your GitHub repository https://github.com/PBA-Dev/PGRechner.git as the starting point.

This sounds like a significant but achievable set of enhancements. Let's break it down.

1. Initial Analysis (Document & Repo):

Document Analysis (NBA-tooldoc.docx): I need to thoroughly analyze this document to understand the exact requirements for:
The precise wording and scoring of all questions in Modules 1-6, paying close attention to any discrepancies with your current implementation.
The exact structure and scoring logic for Module 5 (frequency inputs, point calculation based on times/day/week/month).
The location and purpose of the "Notes" sections for the Pflegeberater.
The specific list of "Wichtige Leistungen" and how they map to each Pflegegrad.
Any other specific rules or nuances mentioned.
Okay, I have accessed the content of "NBA-tooldoc.docx". It provides a detailed example assessment, including specific question phrasing, scoring, notes sections, and the structure for Module 5, along with the benefits table. This is excellent reference material.

Based on my analysis of the document and understanding of your request regarding the GitHub repo (https://github.com/PBA-Dev/PGRechner.git), here's a breakdown and a proposed plan:

Analysis Summary:

Detailed Questions/Scoring: The document provides the precise wording and structure for questions within each module, using categories like "selbständig" to "unselbständig" or frequency scales. We need to ensure your current module definitions (modules/*.py) align perfectly with this regarding raw point allocation per answer.
Notes Sections: The document confirms the presence of "Meine Notizen:" fields, suggesting free-text areas are needed within the UI for relevant modules (Modules 3, 5, 6 shown in the example).
Missing Questions: You correctly identified the last question in Module 4 ("Ernährung parenteral oder über Sonde") which needs to be added. We should cross-reference the doc against your current code for any other potential omissions.
Module 5 Complexity: This is the most significant change. The document breaks Module 5 into parts, requiring frequency inputs (pro Tag/Woche/Monat) for several criteria. The user needs to input numbers, and the backend logic must calculate points based on these frequencies according to the official NBA rules (the document shows an example calculation, but we might need the underlying rule if not fully detailed there).
Benefits Table ("Wichtige Leistungen"): The document shows a detailed breakdown of benefits for Pflegegrad 4, crucially split into two date ranges (Jan-Jun 2025 and Jul 2025 onwards). This requires storing this data and dynamically displaying the relevant table based on the calculated Pflegegrad and potentially the current date.
Feasibility:

Yes, implementing these changes is definitely possible within the existing Flask application structure. It will require careful updates to both the backend logic (Python files) and the frontend templates (HTML files). Module 5 will require the most significant refactoring.

Proposed Implementation Plan:

Here’s a phased approach to tackle these enhancements systematically:

Phase 1: Backend Foundation & Module Alignment

Benefits Data Structure:
Create a new configuration file (e.g., config/benefits_data.py) or extend pflegegrad_config.py.
Define a Python dictionary mapping each Pflegegrad (0-5) to its corresponding list of benefits (description, amount, period - potentially handling the Jan-Jun/Jul+ split for 2025).
Align Modules 1, 2, 3, 6:
Review modules/module1.py, module2.py, module3.py, module6.py.
Update question text, answer options, and raw point values for each answer to perfectly match the NBA-tooldoc.docx.
Update Module 4:
Add the "Ernährung parenteral oder über Sonde" question with its specific options and scoring to modules/module4.py.
Refactor Module 5 (modules/module5.py):
Redefine Structure: Change the module definition to represent the different parts and frequency-based questions. Instead of simple options, some questions will need placeholders for frequency inputs (Tag/Woche/Monat).
Implement Scoring Logic: Add Python functions within or callable by module5.py to calculate the points for each part based on the entered frequencies, according to the official NBA rules (we need to ensure we have these rules). Calculate the final Module 5 raw score.
Update Calculation Route (app.py):
Modify the main calculate function to correctly process the new input format from Module 5 (frequencies).
Ensure it calls the new Module 5 scoring logic.
Add logic to retrieve the correct benefits data from the config based on the final calculated pflegegrad. Pass this benefits data to the result.html template context.
Phase 2: Frontend User Interface

Module Template (module_page.html or similar):
Update the template logic to render questions and answers exactly as defined in the updated module files.
Module 5 UI: Implement conditional rendering for Module 5. For frequency-based questions, display labels (Tag/Woche/Monat) and corresponding <input type="number" min="0"> fields. Ensure these inputs have appropriate name attributes for form submission (e.g., module_5_q3_tag, module_5_q3_woche).
Notes UI: Add <textarea name="module_{{ module_id }}_notes"> elements at the end of the sections for Modules 3, 5, and 6 (and any others specified).
Results Template (result.html):
Benefits Table: Add a new section to display the benefits. Use Jinja templating to iterate through the benefits data passed from app.py and render it in a clear table format. Potentially add logic to show the correct date range (Jan-Jun or Jul+).
Display Notes: Add sections to display the notes entered by the user for each relevant module (retrieve this from the results data passed by app.py).
Phase 3: Data Flow & PDF Generation

Form Submission:
Ensure the frequency inputs from Module 5 and the text areas for notes are correctly submitted with the form data from the module pages.
Session/Data Handling (app.py):
Modify the routes handling module submissions to capture the new frequency inputs and notes text. Store this data appropriately (likely within the session['module_answers'] structure or a parallel structure in the session).
Update detailed_results JSON:
Modify the calculate route to include the entered notes and the detailed Module 5 inputs/results within the results dictionary that gets passed to result.html.
Ensure the value='{{ results | tojson | safe }}' in result.html correctly serializes this expanded data structure.
Update PDF Generation (generate_pdf in app.py):
Modify the function to parse the notes and detailed Module 5 data from the received detailed_results JSON.
Add sections in the PDF layout to print the entered notes under the relevant module headings.
Add logic to clearly display the Module 5 results, potentially including the entered frequencies and the calculated points for each part.
Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

Unit Testing (Optional but Recommended): Write tests for the new Module 5 scoring logic.
Integration Testing: Thoroughly test the end-to-end flow: filling out all modules (especially M5), checking calculations, verifying notes display, checking benefits table accuracy for different Pflegegrade, and validating the generated PDF content.
UI/UX: Refine the appearance and usability of the Module 5 inputs, notes areas, and benefits table.
Clarification Needed:

Module 5 Scoring Rules: Does the NBA-tooldoc.docx fully detail how the points are calculated from the frequencies (e.g., how many points for "Medikation 3 times per day")? If not, we'll need the official NBA guideline document or specification for this logic.
This plan provides a structured way forward. We can tackle it phase by phase, starting with the backend data structures and logic. Let me know if this plan makes sense and if you have the specific scoring rules for Module 5.
